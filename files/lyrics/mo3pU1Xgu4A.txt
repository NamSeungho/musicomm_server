모트(Motte) - SLUSH
너랑 만난 적이 있었나
낯설지가 않아
대답이라도 좀 해봐(tell me what you want baby)
뭔가 달라 그렇게
쳐다보지마
시간이 없어 날 안아줘(can't let you go)

머릿속을 맴돌아
stay with me stay with you
all day 널 지켜줄게
밤새 곁에 있을게
혼자 외롭지 않게
You're not longer lonely at tonight

think about you and think about you
something happened to me
falling in love with you baby

보고 싶은 마음에
think about you and think about you
somebody wake me up
everyday 날 쓰다듬어줘
I need you
I need you
I need you

언제까지 그렇게
쳐다만 볼래
시간이 없어 널 안을래(can't let you go)

머릿속을 맴돌아
stay with me stay with you
all day 널 지켜줄게
밤새 곁에 있을게
혼자 외롭지 않게
You're not longer lonely at tonight

think about you and think about you
something happened to me
falling in love with you baby
보고 싶은 마음에
think about you and think about you
somebody wake me up
everyday 날 쓰다듬어줘
I need you

love love love with you
call call call my name
and and on and on
tell me what you want
i am all of you

이렇게 내 생각에
들어와버린 너
falling in love with you baby
보고 싶은 마음에
think about you and think about you
somebody wake me up
(everyday) everyday oh
(everyday) I need you boy
(everyday) I need you my boy
I need you
