Gloria
My Gloria
Things ain’t been the same
Since you went away

Gloria
My Gloria
I don’t want to see
Another day

It seems like
Only yesterday
I beheld your sweet face
And In my lonely room
My memories of your embrace

Gloria
My Gloria
Things ain’t been the same
Since you went away

Gloria
My Gloria
I don’t want to see
Another day

Isn’t it funny
How time can change
All the things you want to believe
But time won’t change
The way I feel
Cause in my mind
It’s you and me
You and me

Gloria
My Gloria
Things ain’t been the same
Since you went away
(I just can’t go on)

Gloria
My Gloria
I don’t want to see
Another day

(So lonely girl)

Isn’t it funny
How time can change
All the things you want to believe
But time won’t change
The way I feel
Cause in my mind
It’s still you and me
You and me

Gloria
My Gloria
Things ain’t been the same
Since you went away
(I just can’t go on)

Gloria
My Gloria
I don’t want to see
Another day

I don’t want to see another day
Without your lover
I don’t want to see another day
It’s a real sad thing 
But I don’t want to see
Without your lover
(I don’t want to see) another day
It’s gonna hurt me
But (I don’t want to see) 
another day

I just think no way
No longer 
Another day
(I don’t want to see)

I just can’t let her be 
I still love ... 

(I don’t want to see)
Can’t you hear me
Another day

(I don’t want to see)
