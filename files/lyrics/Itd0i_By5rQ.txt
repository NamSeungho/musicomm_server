에릭남 - Love Die Young
What happens when it’s over 
When we’ve breathed our last breath 
And we’ve loved each other to death 
Can you tell me what happens?

I wonder where the love goes
When pleasure turns to pain
When the memories fade away
Can you tell me what happens?

Flowers in your hair now on our grave 
A little bit of pressure’s all it takes
Shoulda known we’d shatter 
that we’d break, break

Maybe I’m the one that we should blame
For never thinking we’d end up this way
I don’t need answers I need you to stay
stay 

Please don’t let this love die young 
Please don’t let this love die young 
If I’m gonna lose someone 
Don't let it be you 
Please don’t let this love die young 
Please don’t let this love die young 
If I’m gonna love someone
Then let it be you 

In my dreams we’re growing older 
But I wake up to the truth 
That I’m scared we’re gonna lose 
Tell me it won’t happen 

So before it’s really over 
Can we have a little faith 
Baby say it ain’t too late
It’s all that I’m asking

Maybe I’m the one that we should blame
For never thinking we’d end up this way
I don’t need answers I need you to stay
stay 

Please don’t let this love die young 
Please don’t let this love die young 
If I’m gonna lose someone 
Don't let it be you 
Please don’t let this love die young 
Please don’t let this love die young 
If I’m gonna love someone
Then let it be you 

Please don’t let it die
Please don’t let it die
Please don’t let it die young

Flowers in your hair now on our grave 
A little bit of pressure’s all it takes
Shoulda known we’d shatter, that we’d break

Please don’t let this love die young 
Please don’t let this love die young 
If I’m gonna lose someone 
Don't let it be you 
Please don’t let this love die young 
Please don’t let this love die young 
If I’m gonna love someone
Then let it be you
