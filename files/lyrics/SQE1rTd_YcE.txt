에릭남 - Congratulations (Feat. Marc E. Bassy)
I’ll bring balloons you get cups
Dress up in your favorite tux 
Champagne for the two of us 
I’ll set the table yea

I’m bringing that ring I bought 
You do with it what you want 
A souvenir or some junk 
You decide tonight

Congratulations 
You’re finally leaving 
Let’s throw a party here tonight 
And toast to the end of you and I 
Congratulations 
You finally mean it 
Let’s throw a party here tonight 
And raise up a glass 
To our last goodbye 

Oh, oh, congratulations 
Our last goodbye

You leave and I’ll pave the way
Let’s end on a high note baby
We both knew the day would come 
When we’d say our last goodbye oh yea
I always was there for you
But you made it unbearable
The worst part is all my friends knew about it before I did, yea
The rumors got too loud round town
You was behind my back bending round 
And don’t think I don’t know it girl
Thats why I’m sad to see you go so

Congratulations 
You’re finally leaving 
Let’s throw a party here tonight 
And toast to the end of you and I 
Congratulations 
You finally mean it 
Let’s throw a party here tonight 
And raise up a glass to our last goodbye  

Ooh ooh Congratulations
For our last goodbye

Congratulations baby
Now that you’re finally leaving 
Let’s throw a party here 
And toast to you and I 
Congratulations baby 
I guess you really mean it 
Let’s throw a party here 
And toast to you and I

Congratulations 
You’re finally leaving 
Let’s throw a party here tonight 
And toast to the end of you and I 
Congratulations 
You finally mean it 
Let’s throw a party here tonight 
And raise up a glass 
To our last goodbye
