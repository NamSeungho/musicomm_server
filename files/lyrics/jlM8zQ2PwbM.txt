DEAN(딘) - Put my hands on you (Feat. Anderson .Paak)
I should be patient but can’t hardly wait
something I wanted since the first day
We should go on with what we’re thinking bout
how could I know

And she said if you like this it’s yours it’s yours
(and I don’t even gotta think about it)
(I don’t even gotta talk about it)
And she said do what you wish it’s yours it’s yours

Ooh Look here baby, ay yi yi yi
I just wanna put my hands on you
I just wanna put my hands on you (on you)

Ooh when we’re faded, ay yi yi yi
I just wanna put my hands on you
I just wanna put my hands on you (on you)

I know you say you really like it
You never been here before (no)
I think we could be on to something
it feels so good to hold (feels good to me)
You tell me if it’s too much (no)
Maybe we should take it slow
I think we could be onto something when you told me baby

And she said if you like this it’s yours it’s yours
(and I don’t even gotta think about it)
(I don’t even gotta talk about it)
And she said do what you wish it’s yours it’s yours
(and I don’t even gotta think about it)
(I don’t even gotta talk about it)

Ooh Look here baby, ay yi yi yi
I just wanna put my hands on you
I just wanna put my hands on you (on you)

Ooh when we’re faded, ay yi yi yi
I just wanna put my hands on you
I just wanna put my hands on you (on you)

Hey
She don’t even try
But I believe she knows
Tell me just how far can I go
She don’t need to try
She don’t have to act the part
I love your body

Face in the pillow, ass where the wind blows
everytime we link up, sex is all we think up
Body like a city I got keys and the zip code
we don’t even speak much, all we do is drink up
shots of the (참이슬)chamisul, blue dream chief up
jagiya iriwa bbal li wa gaza (자기야, 이리와 빨리와, 가자)
all this love I hope it don’t hurt ya
all this love I hope it’s all worth it
perfect in the end perfect way
jerkin, tugging on my shirt like
“Ay I know you wanna get a taste”

And she said if you like this it’s yours it’s yours
(and I don’t even gotta think about it)
(I don’t even gotta talk about it)
And she said do what you wish it’s yours it’s yours
(and I don’t even gotta think about it)
(I don’t even gotta talk about it)

Ooh Look here baby, ay yi yi yi
I just wanna put my hands on you
I just wanna put my hands on you (on you)

Ooh when we’re faded, ay yi yi yi
I just wanna put my hands on you
I just wanna put my hands on you (on you)
