몬스타엑스 - YOU CAN'T HOLD MY HEART
Oh, can you stay awake?
One more hour, maybe this can change
Oh, can you numb the pain?
'Cause it runs deep in constant waves
How's it gonna work when we can’t admit it?
Pretend that we don’t know now
Tried to drag it out, but we beared it livin'
We can let it go now
And there's nothing I can say at all
You can't hold my heart no more
And I'm waiting for your arms to fall
You can't hold my heart no more
Yeah, there's nothing I can say at all
You can't hold my heart no more
And I'm waiting for your arms to fall
You can't hold my heart no more
We made a city sound, had a fire but it's dying down
We tried to make a wave, but we got lost and swept away
How's it gonna work when we can't admit it?
Pretend that we don't know now
Trying to drag it out, but we beared it livin'
We can let it go now
Yeah, there's nothing I can say at all
You can't hold my heart no more
And I'm waiting for your arms to fall
You can’t hold my heart no more
I know you tryna hold on close, but it’s slipping through your fingertips
I know you try to hold on close
Yeah, there's nothing I can say at all
You can't hold my heart no more
And I'm waiting for your arms to fall
You can't hold my heart no more
