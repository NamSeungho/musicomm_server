스탠딩 에그(Standing Egg) - Ironic
In the empty space
Sun has hid its face
nothing to be heard
there’s no your “Hey, How was your day?”
in the end of day
will you be in bed
thinking about me
the Love last forever
It’s the word from you
Nothing last forever
I believe it’s true
Something has to go on
in our history
it’s an ironic story
Whenever you say I’m sorry
I’m ready to go in hurry
Whenever we stay in silence
Time is passing by
Don’t be complicated
Love is incomplete
All I need is you beside me
All I need is you beside me
the Love last forever
It’s the word from you
Nothing last forever
I believe it’s true
Something has to go on
in our history
it’s an ironic story
Forget the forever
Leaving for later
But later comes never
Shortened letter
Your touch
Turns to
Hush Push
Gosh look us
Turned into pieces
Whenever you say I’m sorry
I’m ready to go in hurry
Whenever we stay in silence
Time is passing by
Don’t be complicated
Love is incomplete
All I need is you beside me
All I need is you beside me
Whenever you say I’m sorry
I’m ready to go in hurry
Whenever we stay in silence
Time is passing by
Don’t be complicated
Love is incomplete
All I need is you beside me
All I need is you beside me
In the empty space
Sun has hid its face
nothing to be heard there’s no your “Hey, How was your day?”
in the end of day
will you be in bed
thinking about me
the Love last forever
It’s the word from you
Nothing last forever
I believe it’s true
Something has to go on
in our history
it’s an ironic story
