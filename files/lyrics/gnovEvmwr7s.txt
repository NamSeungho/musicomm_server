정기고 - warm
You can take it slow
They’re talking shit about me on the radio
How am I supposed to know bout you
Just let me know cause I need to know
Are you the kind to keep me warm

아무도 없는 객석 
새벽에 나타난 천사는 
밤낮이 바뀐 삶을 살아

가지 말고 조금만 얘기해줘
천천히 너를 내게 나눠줘 

천천히 해
우린 겁내지 않아 새로운 얘기에
아무도 없는 거리에
외로운 밤이 잠시 머물다 가네
밖에 비가 오네

You can take it slow
They’re talking shit about me on the radio
How am I supposed to know bout you
Just let me know cause I need to know
Are you the kind to keep me warm

우린 여전히
엉망이고 서툴지만 
그냥 괜찮을지 몰라 이대로

You can take it slow
They’re talking shit about me on the radio
How am I supposed to know bout you
Just let me know cause I need to know
Are you the kind to keep me warm
