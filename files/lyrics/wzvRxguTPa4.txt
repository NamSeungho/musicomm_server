DEAN(딘) - I'm not sorry (Feat. Eric Bellinger)
I live my life like this
Tell me how could 
I miss giving you 
everything you deserve
You know I be doin 
the most while you 
be back at home
I promise baby it could be worse
I'm out here gettin my money, 
everyday sunny, 
steez on flame I know I know
Tellin my chauffeur hurry up 
and wait too too
He be like too too
Time to hit that road, zoom
You on your solo while 
I'm takin photos to post
I know you feel crazy now

I'm sorry, no, I'm not sorry
I'm just gettin started, 
and my life's a party
So I'm turnin' turnin' turnin' 
turnin' turnin' turnin' turnin up
Said I'm turnin' turnin' turnin' 
turnin' turnin' turnin up

Girl, I forgot about missin you
Said I forgot about missin you
I've been too busy out 
gettin my yaper
I ain't got time to 
be thinkin bout you
I've been on your mind, True
Twenty racks on my wrist still 
I ain't got time for you
Homegirls lookin at me like
What's up what's up
What's good, what's good 
Where you at right now
How long will you be on 
my side of town
Chillen in Itaewon
Take a look at my passport now
I been gettin that money
I ain't tryin to hurt you 
but I gotta keep it, 100
The whole world know me now

I'm sorry, no, I'm not sorry
I'm just gettin started 
and my life's a party
So I'm turnin' turnin' turnin' 
turnin' turnin' turnin up
Said I'm turnin' turnin' turnin' 
turnin' turnin' turnin up
I'm sorry, no, I'm not sorry
I'm just gettin started 
and my life's a party
So I'm turnin' turnin' turnin' 
turnin' turnin' turnin up
Said I'm turnin' turnin' turnin' 
turnin' turnin' turnin up

Girl, I ain't thinkin bout you
No, I ain't thinkin bout you
Girl, I ain't frontin, 
I'm really stunting,
just speakin the truth
Girl you'be lyin if you said 
you don't see me now

Watch me go on 
and act a fool
Hear me when I say

I'm sorry, no, I'm not sorry
I'm just gettin started 
and my life's a party
So I'm turnin' turnin' turnin' 
turnin' turnin' turnin up
Said I'm turnin' turnin' turnin' 
turnin' turnin' turnin up

I'm sorry, no, I'm not sorry
I'm just gettin started 
and my life's a party
So I'm turnin' turnin' 
turnin' turnin' turnin' up
You know I’m turnin' 
turnin' turnin' turnin' turnin' up

Turnin up, turnin up
Too busy turnin up, turnin up
I’ve been turnin up turnin up
And I’m not sorry, 
I’m not sorry baby
I’m not sorry, 
I’m not sorry babe
I’m not sorry, 
I’m not sorry baby
I’m not sorry, 
I’m not sorry baby
I’m not sorry, 
I’m not sorry babe
