에픽하이(EPIK HIGH) - 눈, 코, 입 Cover
You left me paralyzed.
No cure. No rehab for me.
Funny that you got the nerve to keep askin’ me how I’ve been. 
You're the victor in this pageantry.
But the only trophy you deserve... catastrophe.
I'd rather we be dead to each other.
No eulogies said for each other.
No rest in peace's.
The memory's got my chest in pieces.
I'm prayin' that your eyes are the first to go.
The way they looked when you smiled. 
The way they opened and closed.
Then your nose.
Every single breath against my neck.
And then your lips. 
Every empty promise made and said.

Please fade.
Fade to black.
Please fade.
Fade to black.
But the nightmares come back.

Because your eyes, nose, 
lips—every look and every breath, 
every kiss—still got me dyin'.
You still got me cryin'.
Because your eyes, nose, 
lips—every look and every breath, 
every kiss—still got me dyin'.
You still got me cryin'.

Forget a promenade. 
Let's juggernaut down memory lane.
Leave no thought alive.
To the slaughterhouse I'm takin' my pain.
It's time to sever my brain from my heart and soul.
My knees are burnin' hot
but God is cold. 

I've been told
One day you'll know, too much of heaven's a sin.
After the show, it's only hell that it brings.
So take it slow and let time heal everything.
They say that time flies
but you keep breakin' its wings.

You'll never fade.
Fade to black.
Please fade.
Fade to black.
But the nightmares come back.

Because your eyes, nose, 
lips—every look and every breath, 
every kiss—still got me dyin'.
You still got me cryin'.
Because your eyes, nose, 
lips—every look and every breath, 
every kiss—still got me dyin'.
You still got me cryin'.

You wish me well.
You wish me well.
I wish you hell.

I never wanna look into your eyes again.
No, I never wanna hear you breathe again.
Let me go.
Let me go.
Baby, tell me this is the end.

Because your eyes, nose, 
lips—every look and every breath, 
every kiss—still got me dyin'.
You still got me cryin'.
Because your eyes, nose, 
lips—every look and every breath, 
every kiss—still got me dyin'.
You still got me cryin'.

G’night.
