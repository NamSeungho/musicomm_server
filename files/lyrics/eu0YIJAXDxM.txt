에디킴, 수빈 - Dream
if I wanna be a hero 
would you believe in my dream 
if I decide not to chase 
would you walk with me to dream 

maybe I don’t know the world 
but I know where I should belong
it's time to say good bye 
to all the worries I had 

oh I can do anything
if I can sing with all my heart 
oh I just want nothing at all 
as long as you are by my side

oh I just want nothing
if I can sing with all my heart 
oh I just want nothing at all 
as long as you are by my side
and I will sing with all your heart

if I lose my way to go
would you tell me where the road is
when I'm all byself 
would you sing my favorite song

maybe I don’t know the world 
but I know where I should belong
it's time to say good bye 
to all the worries I had 

oh I can do anything
if I can sing with all my heart 
oh I just want nothing at all 
as long as you are by my side

oh I just want nothing
if I can sing with all my heart 
oh I just want nothing at all 
as long as you are by my side
and I will sing with all your heart
and I will sing with all your heart
