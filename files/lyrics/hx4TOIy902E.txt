몬스타엑스 - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
You make me want to run it all back
Nobody's ever done me like that

I thought I'd never ever need you
Now all I want to do is see you

I shouldn't let it happen so fast
Girl why'd you have to break me like that

Your love is nothing but a see-through
I tell myself that I should leave you

But who, I don't wanna know
Where you wanna go
Who you're taking home

Cause I can't lose everything I know
I hate sleeping alone
I'm picking up the phone

And I'll be on the way in the middle of the night
Cause I can never wait for the morning to rise
We're kissing in the car underneath of the night
You got me
You got me

And I'll be on the way in the middle of the night
It's something in the way you've been running my mind
If you want me to stay for the rest of my life
You got me
You got me

Remember all the nights like this
Sleeping in the Motel 6
We'll take all of the back streets on
Making sure your friends don't know

I've never thought it get like this
Still think about the very first kiss

But I could never lie to you
I'm going out of my mind for you

But who, I don't wanna know
Where you wanna go
Who you're taking home

Cause I can't lose everything I know
I hate sleeping alone
I'm picking up the phone

And I'll be on the way in the middle of the night
Cause I can never wait for the morning to rise
We're kissing in the car underneath of the light
You got me
You got me

And I'll be on the way in the middle of the night
It's something in the way you've been running my mind
If you want me to stay for the rest of my life
You got me
You got me

And I'll be on the way in the middle of the night
Cause I can never wait for the morning to rise
We're kissing in the car underneath of the night
You got me
You got me

And I'll be on the way in the middle of the night
It's something in the way you've been running my mind
If you want me to stay for the rest of my life
You got me
You got me

Go back to our own ways in the middle of the night
Go back to our own ways in the middle of the night
Go back to our own ways in the middle of the night
Go back to our own ways in the middle of the night
Go back to our own ways in the middle of the night
